title: Snowfall Lib v3 Migration
description: Migrate from Snowfall Lib v2 to v3
---

Snowfall Lib v3 improves Home-Manager integration and introduces some quality of life
improvements to the library. To migrate from v2 to v3, follow the steps below.

# Home-Manager

Changes have been made to the way that Snowfall Lib works with Home-Manager and its modules.
In previous versions `homeModules` were often not loaded correctly and certain features like
imports and internal packages were unavailable in different circumstances.

With Snowfall Lib v3, `home-manager.useGlobalPkgs` is now defaulted to `true` which will result
in the same package set (including internal packages) being used in your user homes. In order to
resolve the issue with home-manager modules and imports, all home-manager configuration must now
be performed through the options in `snowfallorg.user.${user-name}.home.config`. This is an
attribute set which maps directly to your home configuration.

```nix
{
    # Before
    home-manager.users.my-user.packages = with pkgs; [
        my-package
    ];
}
```

```nix
{
    # After
    snowfallorg.user.my-user.home.config.packages = with pkgs; [
        my-package
    ];
}
```

In addition, `specialArgs` are now passed to Home-Manager modules even when used within your
NixOS configuration. This previously only worked standalone.

# Overlays

Overlay inputs have been reworked to be more useful and less surprising. Now overlays are passed
`lib` and `inputs` arguments in addition to `channels`.

```nix
# Before
{ my-input, channels, ... }:
final: prev: {
    # ...
}
```

```nix
# After
{ inputs, channels, lib, ... }:
let
    my-input = inputs.my-input;
in
final: prev: {
    # ...
}
```

Inputs are still available as named arguments, but this usage is deprecated and will be removed
in a future release.

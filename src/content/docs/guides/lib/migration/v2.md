title: Snowfall Lib v2 Migration
description: Migrate from Snowfall Lib v1 to v2
---

Snowfall Lib v2 adds a large amount of features and has made a few breaking changes that
are in the benefit of overall user experience. To migrate from v1 to v2, see the following
steps.

## Namespace

The `overlay-package-namespace` option has been removed in favor of using `snowfall.namespace`.

```nix
inputs.snowfall-lib.mkFlake {
    # Before:
    # overlay-package-namespace = "my-namespace";

    # After:
    snowfall.namespace = "my-namespace";
}
```

In addition, packages and your flake library now default to the `internal` namespace.

## Aliases

Output aliases are no longer automatically remapped from strings returned from `outputs-builder`.
Instead, use the new `alias` option to configure aliases.

```nix
inputs.snowfall-lib.mkFlake {
    # Before:
    # outputs-builder = channels: {
    #     packages.default = "my-package";
    # };

    # After:
    alias.packages.default = "my-package";
}
```

## External Modules

Modules must now be added to a specific system or system type. Previously Snowfall Lib assumed
modules were all compatible NixOS modules. This has been extended to also support Darwin modules.

:::note
Modules may still be added to specific systems via `systems.hosts.<my-host>.modules`.
:::

```nix
inputs.snowfall-lib.mkFlake {
    # Before:
    # systems.modules = with inputs; [
    #     my-input.nixosModules.my-module
    # };

    # After:
    systems.modules.nixos = with inputs; [
        my-input.nixosModules.my-module
    };
    systems.modules.darwin = with inputs; [
        my-input.darwinModules.my-module
    };
}
```

## `lib.snowfall.*`

The default arguments for many functions (particularly `modules` and `system`) have been updated
to support multiple different platforms like Darwin and Home Manager. Please verify that you are
now expecting to use the most recent, new structure imposed by Snowfall Lib.

title: Snowfall Lib v2 Migration
description: Migrate from Snowfall Lib v1 to v2
---

Snowfall Lib v2 adds a large amount of features and has made a few breaking changes that
are in the benefit of overall user experience. To migrate from v1 to v2, see the following
steps.

## Namespace

The `overlay-package-namespace` option has been removed in favor of using `snowfall.namespace`.

```nix
 inputs.snowfall-lib.mkFlake {
    # Before:
    # overlay-package-namespace = "my-namespace";

    # After:
    snowfall.namespace = "my-namespace";
 }
```

In addition, packages and your flake library now default to the `internal` namespace.

## Aliases

Output aliases are no longer automatically remapped from strings returned from `outputs-builder`.
Instead, use the new `alias` option to configure aliases.

```nix
 inputs.snowfall-lib.mkFlake {
    # Before:
    # outputs-builder = channels: {
    #     packages.default = "my-package";
    # };

    # After:
    alias.packages.default = "my-package";
 }
```

## `lib.snowfall.*`

The default arguments for many functions (particularly `modules` and `system`) have been updated
to support multiple different platforms like Darwin and Home Manager. Please verify that you are
now expecting to use the most recent, new structure imposed by Snowfall Lib.

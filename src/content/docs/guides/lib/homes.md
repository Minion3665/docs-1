description: Creating homes with Snowfall Lib.
---

To create a new home, add a new directory to your `homes` directory.

:::note
Remember to run `git add` when creating new files!
:::

```bash
# Create a directory in the `homes` directory for a new home. This should follow
# Snowfall Lib's required home target format to ensure that the correct architecture
# and output are used.
mkdir -p ./homes/x86_64-linux/user@my-home
```

Now create the Nix file for the home at `homes/x86_64-linux/user@my-home/default.nix`.

```nix
{
    # Snowfall Lib provides a customized `lib` instance with access to your flake's library
    # as well as the libraries available from your flake's inputs.
    lib,
    # An instance of `pkgs` with your overlays and packages applied is also available.
    pkgs,
    # You also have access to your flake's inputs.
    inputs,

    # Additional metadata is provided by Snowfall Lib.
    home, # The home architecture for this host (eg. `x86_64-linux`).
    target, # The Snowfall Lib target for this home (eg. `x86_64-home`).
    format, # A normalized name for the home target (eg. `home`).
    virtual, # A boolean to determine whether this home is a virtual target using nixos-generators.
    host, # The host name for this home.

    # All other arguments come from the home home.
    config,
    ...
}:
{
    # Your configuration.
}
```

This home will be made available on your flakeâ€™s `homeConfigurations` output with the same
name as the directory that you created.

Homes can have additional `specialArgs` and `modules` configured within your call to `mkFlake`.
See the following for an example which adds a Home Manager module to a specific host and sets a
custom value in `specialArgs`.

```nix
{
	description = "My Flake";

	inputs = {
		nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-23.05";

		snowfall-lib = {
			url = "github:snowfallorg/lib";
			inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
		};
	};

	outputs = inputs:
        inputs.snowfall-lib.mkFlake {
            inherit inputs;
            src = ./.;

            # Add modules to all homes.
            homes.modules = with inputs; [
                # my-input.homeModules.my-module
            ];

            # Add modules to a specific home.
            homes.users."my-user@my-host".modules = with inputs; [
                # my-input.homeModules.my-module
            ];

            # Add modules to a specific home.
            homes.users."my-user@my-host".specialArgs = {
                my-custom-value = "my-value";
            };
        };
}
```
